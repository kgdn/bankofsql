[![License: AGPL v3](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-AGPL%20v3-blue.svg)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0)

This web server was developed as a part of a collaborative research project undertaken for F20AN - Advanced Network Security course at Heriot-Watt University. 

The web server is intentionally vulnerable and insecure, and was developed to demonstrate the various security vulnerabilities that can be exploited by an attacker to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the web server. The web server is developed using the Flask framework and is written in Python.

## The authors of this web server are not responsible for any misuse of the web server.

By no means should this web server be used in a production environment. In fact, this should never be used at all. The code is so horribly insecure that it should not be used for anything other than educational and research purposes, and for messing around with.

**It is highly recommended to run the web server in a controlled environment, such as a virtual machine, and to not expose it to the internet. The web server should only be used for educational and research purposes.**
